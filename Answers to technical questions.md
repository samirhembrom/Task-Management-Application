## How long did you spend on the coding test?

I took around 7 to 9 hours to complete the project.I still need to work on the styling and few features though.

## What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

I am using React library. I used react-router-dom library. This helped me alot during the development process reducing a lot more complex code. Also the used to various states was reduced. Using the useSubmit hook provided by the library.

## How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

Here's how I would approach performance troubleshooting in production:

1. Gather Data First
2. Narrow Down the Scope
3. Quick Wins Check
4. Deep Dive Tools
5. Test Hypotheses

I have not done any of the troubleshooting.

## If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?

I would try to gamify the application which would make users to stick to the application. Also adding some records of how the well previous tasks have been completed to give an extra motivation to comeback.
